        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Lifters Link; a platform made for and by powerlifters. We're building infrastructure as strong as the sport.</h1>
        <p>Lifters Link is (will be) a comprehensive platform for the global powerlifting community where athletes, coaches, and meet directors can connect, spectate, showcase a history of their performance, and organize, register for, and execute meets.</p>
        <p>Like any good lift needing a warm up, we’re testing some ideas. Based on dozens of customer interviews, live meet notifications emerged as the most pressing concern. We’ve selected a few meets over the coming weeks to validate these findings.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, we’re documenting the build @lifterslink on Instagram and we’d love to have you aboard the ride.</p>
