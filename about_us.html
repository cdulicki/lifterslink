        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>We seek to equip powerlifters with infrastructure as strong as the sport. Lifters Link is a comprehensive platform for the global powerlifting community where athletes, coaches, and meet directors can connect, spectate, showcase a history of their performance, and organize, register for, and execute meets.</p>
        <p>Weâ€™re documenting the build @lifterslink on Instagram if you would like to connect.</p>
